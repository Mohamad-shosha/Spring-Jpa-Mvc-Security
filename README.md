## 📖 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- *Java Development Kit (JDK)* installed (preferably JDK 11 or later).
- *Maven* installed for dependency management.
- Your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) for code editing.
- *Postman* for API testing.

## ✨ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your Spring Boot project quickly and efficiently:

### 🚀 Step 1: Create a Spring Boot Project

Begin by generating a new Spring Boot project using [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) with the following settings:

- **Project**: Maven Project
- **Language**: Java
- **Spring Boot**: Latest stable version
- **Packaging**: Jar
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Spring Web
  - Spring Data JPA
  - Thymeleaf
  - Liquibase
  - MySQL Driver

Click **"Generate"** to download the project zip file.

---

### 📥 Step 2: Extract and Import into IDE

1. Extract the downloaded zip file.
2. Import the project into your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

---

### ⚙️ Step 3: Configure Database and Liquibase

- **Database Configuration**: Update your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file with your database connection details.
  
- **Liquibase Configuration**: Configure Liquibase in your `application.properties` and add your changelog files in `src/main/resources/db/changelog`.
   ```application.properties
   spring.liquibase.change-log=db/changelog/db_master_changelog.xml
   ```

- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data (like database passwords) in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in your `application.properties` file. For example:
  ```application.properties
  database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3307/mydb
  database.username=root
  database.password=shosh404@@

  spring.datasource.url=${database.url}
  spring.datasource.username=${database.username}
  spring.datasource.password=${database.password}
  ```

---

### 🏗️ Step 4: Define Entities

Create entity classes for **Instructor**, **Address**, and **Course** in your project.

---

### 📚 Step 5: Create Repository Interfaces

Define repository interfaces for each entity to enable CRUD operations.

---

### 🔄 Step 6: Implement Service Layer

Develop a service layer to manage business logic and facilitate interaction with repositories.

---

### 🖥️ Step 7: Implement Controllers

Create MVC controllers to manage HTTP requests and return appropriate views.

---

### 🎨 Step 8: Create Thymeleaf Views

Design Thymeleaf templates for displaying forms and results.

---

### 🧪 Step 9: Test Using Postman

Utilize Postman to test your API endpoints by sending requests to create, read, update, and delete entities.

---

### ▶️ Step 10: Run Your Application

Run your Spring Boot application. The server will start at [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082).
